# Reactivity Fundamentals

## Declaring Reactive State

With the Options API, we use the `data` option to declare reactive state of a component. The option value should be a function that returns an object. Vue will call the function when creating a new component instance, and wrap the returned object in its reactivity system. Any top-level properties of this object are proxied on the component instance (`this` in methods and lifecycle hooks):

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 1
    }
  },
    
  mounted() {
    // `this` refers to the component instance.
    console.log(this.count) // => 1

    // data can be mutated as well
    this.count = 2
  }
}
```

These instance properties are only added when the instance is first created, so you need to ensure they are all present in the object returned by the `data` function. Where necessary, use `null`, `undefined` or some other placeholder value for properties where the desired value isn't yet available.

虽然也可以不在 `data` 上定义，直接向组件实例添加新属性，但这个属性将无法触发响应式更新。

Vue 在组件实例上暴露的内置 API 使用 `$` 作为前缀。它同时也为内部属性保留 `_` 前缀。因此，你应该避免在顶层 `data` 上使用任何以这些字符作前缀的属性。

### Reactive Proxy vs. Original

In Vue 3, data is made reactive by leveraging JavaScript Proxies. Users coming from Vue 2 should be aware of the following edge case:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      someObject: {}
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    const newObject = {}
    this.someObject = newObject

    console.log(newObject === this.someObject) // false
  }
}
```

When you access `this.someObject` after assigning it, the value is a reactive proxy of the original `newObject`. **Unlike in Vue 2, the original `newObject` is left intact and will not be made reactive: make sure to always access reactive state as a property of `this`.**

## Declaring Methods

To add methods to a component instance we use the `methods` option. This should be an object containing the desired methods:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // methods can be called in lifecycle hooks, or other methods!
    this.increment()
  }
}
```

Vue automatically binds the `this` value for `methods` so that it always refers to the component instance. This ensures that a method retains the correct `this` value if it's used as an event listener or callback. You should avoid using arrow functions when defining `methods`, as that prevents Vue from binding the appropriate `this` value:

```js
export default {
  methods: {
    increment: () => {
      // BAD: no `this` access here!
    }
  }
}
```

和组件实例上的其他属性一样，方法也可以在模板上被访问。在模板中它们常常被用作事件监听器：

```vue
<button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
```

在上面的例子中，`increment` 方法会在 `<button>` 被点击时调用。

### Deep Reactivity

In Vue, state is deeply reactive by default. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      obj: {
        nested: { count: 0 },
        arr: ['foo', 'bar']
      }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    mutateDeeply() {
      // these will work as expected.
      this.obj.nested.count++
      this.obj.arr.push('baz')
    }
  }
}
```

### DOM Update Timing

When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the nextTick() global API:

```js
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

export default {
  methods: {
    async increment() {
      this.count++
      await nextTick()
      // Now the DOM is updated
    }
  }
}
```

### Stateful Methods

In some cases, we may need to dynamically create a method function, for example creating a debounced event handler:

```js
import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'

export default {
  methods: {
    // Debouncing with Lodash
    click: debounce(function () {
      // ... respond to click ...
    }, 500)
  }
}
```

However, this approach is problematic for components that are reused because a debounced function is **stateful**: it maintains some internal state on the elapsed time. If multiple component instances share the same debounced function, they will interfere with one another.

To keep each component instance's debounced function independent of the others, we can create the debounced version in the `created` lifecycle hook:

```js
export default {
  created() {
    // each instance now has its own copy of debounced handler
    this.debouncedClick = _.debounce(this.click, 500)
  },
  unmounted() {
    // also a good idea to cancel the timer
    // when the component is removed
    this.debouncedClick.cancel()
  },
  methods: {
    click() {
      // ... respond to click ...
    }
  }
}
```
