# JavaScript confirm

## Introduction to JavaScript confirm() method

To invoke a dialog with a question and two buttons `OK` and `Cancel`, you use the `confirm()` method of the `window` object:

```js
let result = window.confirm(message);
```

In this syntax:

- The `message` is an optional string to display in the dialog.
- The `result` is a Boolean value indicating whether the `OK` or `Cancel` button was clicked. If the `OK` button is clicked, the result is `true`; otherwise, the result is `false`.

> Note that if a browser ignores in-page dialogs, then the `result` is always `false`.

The confirmation dialog is modal and synchronous. It means that the code execution stops when a dialog is displayed and resumes after it has been dismissed.

The following example uses the `confirm()` method to invoke a confirmation dialog. Based on the userâ€™s selection, it displays the corresponding message based using the `alert()` method:

```js
let result = confirm('Are you sure you want to delete?');
let message = result ? 'You clicked the OK button' :
    'You clicked the Cancel button';
alert(message);
```
