# JavaScript Navigator

## Introduction to the JavaScript `Navigator` object

The JavaScript Navigator provides information about the web browser and its capabilities. You can reference the Navigator object via the read-only `window.navigator` property.

The `Navigator` object has properties that convey the browser’s information.

The different web browser provides specific capabilities which are not standardized. It’s better not to use the `userAgent` to identify the web browser because some web browsers allow users to modify the userAgent to pretend they are using a different browser.
